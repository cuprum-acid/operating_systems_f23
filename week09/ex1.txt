Random Page Replacement Algorithm:

Provides good performance in situations where randomness helps prevent clustering of page replacements.
Unpredictable and less likely to make intelligent decisions.
The hit ratio may vary significantly.

NFU (Not Frequently Used) Page Replacement Algorithm:

Keeps track of page references and favors evicting pages that are not frequently used.
Effective in reducing the number of page faults when pages have clear usage patterns.

Aging Page Replacement Algorithm:

Uses aging counters to maintain a dynamic history of page references.
Combines aspects of LRU (Least Recently Used) and NFU algorithms.
