In this task, we used different approach to divide thread loads.

It gave almost similar results like in ex3, but on 100 number of threads,
program starts to execute slower compared with 10 and even 4 threads. It may be explained, that program spend 
computational power to devide load on large amount of threads wich slows down the execution time of the program.
So, we can conclude that performance of multi-threaded program depends on the number of threads.
Big number of threads may increase execution time by forcing program to sepnd time on distributing computational power.
And small number of threads may be not enough for program to execute in fastest way.
