In this exercise, we implemented a message publication system using named pipes for inter-process communication.
The system consisted of one publisher and multiple subscribers, each running in separate processes.

To assess the functionality of the system, we observed the output of all running subscribers and checked whether they received the message correctly.

Each subscriber successfully received the messages published by the publisher & messages were delivered to all subscribers without loss or interference.

In our implementation, we created n named pipes one for each subscriber.
This design choice ensured that each subscriber had its dedicated communication channel with the publisher.
Having n named pipes eliminated issues like message interleaving, where parts of different messages could mix together when using a single named pipe for all subscribers.
By providing a unique named pipe to each subscriber, we maintained data isolation and prevented message collisions.
