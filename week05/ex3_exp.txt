In this task, we calculated the number of prime numbers in the range [0, 10000000)
using multi-threading with different number of threads (1 2 4 10 100)

After analysing execution time of each case we can make such conclusion:
The more threads, the faster the program was executed. 
But the biggest performance improvement occured when we used 2
threads instead of one: performance almost doubled. Further increase in
the number of threads also improved performance, but not so significatly.
