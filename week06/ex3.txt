The output of this program is different.
This is because we use two different scheduling algorithms: Here we use Shortest Job First,
and in previous exercise we used FCFS.
As we obtained small burst time, performed by SJF, our output expected to be smaller compared to the FCFS.
Also, order of execution changed.
